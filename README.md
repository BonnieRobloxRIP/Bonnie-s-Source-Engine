The contents of this add-on are highly experimental and subject to change at any moment.
The branches are purely assets from other maps that could come in handy to those who use this add-on for more detailed crafts.
These assets are also in use in their respective maps as well.
Some branches are from valve titles like Portal 2 and Team Fortress 2 which are for the people who would want to use such assets with the now existing engine.
The base add-on is only the main functionality stuff all maps by BonnieRobloxRIP use (will use)
Uploading a map with these add-ons requires direct approval from me(BonnieRobloxRIP) and credits in the description of said project. I can be reached at my own discord server
Thank you and have fun
